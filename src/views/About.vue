    <h4>This is an internship group project made under Apsit Skills Program. This site basically provides you to compare items (majorly electronic equipments and some sport & cosmetic related products) from various E-Commerce sites. We have used DataYuge's API for comparing prices. In future we desire to make our own REST API, to make our site more effective.</h4>
